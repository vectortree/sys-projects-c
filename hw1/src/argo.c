 * information on the JSON syntax standard and how parsing can be
 * accomplished.  As discussed in the assignment handout, the returned
 * pointer must be to one of the elements of the argo_value_storage
 * array that is defined in the const.h header file.
 * In case of an error (these include failure of the input to conform
 * to the JSON standard, premature EOF on the input stream, as well as
 * other I/O errors), a one-line error message is output to standard error
 * and a NULL pointer value is returned.
 *
 * @param f  Input stream from which JSON is to be read.
